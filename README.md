  <summary>NuExtract for NER</summary>
  
  This notebook demonstrates the use of the `NuExtract` model for **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** tasks. NER is a natural language processing (NLP) technique aimed at identifying specific entities, such as person names, locations, and organizations, within a text. This notebook explains the NER process using `NuExtract` and provides a step-by-step guide on extracting meaningful information from text.

  **Contents:**
  - Installation and setup of the NuExtract model.
  - Training and testing the model with sample data.
  - Performance evaluation and example outputs.

  This notebook serves as a tutorial for those interested in NER processes and provides a foundation for text analysis applications using `NuExtract`.

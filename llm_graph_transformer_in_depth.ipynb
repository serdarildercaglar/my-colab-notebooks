        "Creating graphs from text is incredibly exciting, but definitely challenging. Essentially, it's about converting unstructured text into structured data. While this approach has been around for some time, it gained significant traction with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), bringing it more into the mainstream.\n",

        "In the image above, you can see how information extraction transforms raw text into a knowledge graph. On the left, multiple documents show unstructured sentences about individuals and their relationships with companies. On the right, this same information is represented as a graph of entities and their connections, showing who worked at or founded various organizations.\n",
        "But why would you want to extract structured information from text and represent it as a graph? One key reason is to power retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications. While using text embedding models over unstructured text is an useful approach, it can fall short when it comes to answering complex, multi-hop questions that require understanding connections across multiple entities or question where structured operations like filtering, sorting, and aggregation is required. By extracting structured information from text and constructing knowledge graphs, you not only organize data more effectively but also create a powerful framework for understanding complex relationships between entities. This structured approach makes it much easier to retrieve and leverage specific information, expanding the types of questions you can answer while providing greater accuracy.\n",

        "The LLM Graph Transformer was designed to provide a flexible framework for building graphs using any LLM. With so many different providers and models available, this task is far from simple. Fortunately, LangChain steps in to handle much of the standardization process. As for the LLM Graph Transformer itself, it's like two cats stacked in a trench coat -with the ability to operate in two completely independent modes.\n",
        "\n",
        "![image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*aCSCXuvrOB90jRQ0mNZtSA.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "The LLM Graph Transformer operates in two distinct modes, each designed to generate graphs from documents using an LLM in different scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Tool-Based Mode (Default)**: When the LLM supports structured output or function calling, this mode leverages the LLM's built-in with_structured_outputto use tools. The tool specification defines the output format, ensuring that entities and relationships are extracted in a structured, predefined manner. This is depicted on the left side of the image, where code for the Node and Relationship classes is shown.\n",
        "* **Prompt-Based Mode (Fallback)** : In situations where the LLM doesn't support tools or function calls, the LLM Graph Transformer falls back to a purely prompt-driven approach. This mode uses few-shot prompting to define the output format, guiding the LLM to extract entities and relationships in a text-based manner. The results are then parsed through a custom function, which converts the LLM's output into a JSON format. This JSON is used to populate nodes and relationships, just as in the tool-based mode, but here the LLM is guided entirely by prompting rather than structured tools. This is shown on the right side of the image, where an example prompt and resulting JSON output are provided.\n",
        "\n",
        "These two modes ensure that the LLM Graph Transformer is adaptable to different LLMs, allowing it to build graphs either directly using tools or by parsing output from a text-based prompt.\n",
        "\n",
        "_Note that you can use prompt-based extraction even with models that support tools/functions by setting the attribute ignore_tools_usage=True._\n",
        "\n",
        "## Tool-based extraction\n",
        "We initially chose a tool-based approach for extraction since it minimized the need for extensive prompt engineering and custom parsing functions. In LangChain, the with_structured_output method allows you to extract information using tools or functions, with output defined either through a JSON structure or a Pydantic object. Personally, I find Pydantic objects clearer, so we opted for that.\n",
        "We start by defining a Node class.\n",
        "```\n",
        "class Node(BaseNode):\n",
        "    id: str = Field(..., description=\"Name or human-readable unique identifier\")\n",
        "    label: str = Field(..., description=f\"Available options are {enum_values}\")\n",
        "    properties: Optional[List[Property]]\n",
        "```\n",
        "Each node has an id, a label, and optional properties. For brevity, I haven't included full descriptions here. Describing ids as human-readable unique identifier is important since some LLMs tend to understand ID properties in more traditional way like random strings or incremental integers. Instead we want the name of entities to be used as id property. We also limit the available label types by simply listing them in the labeldescription. Additionally, LLMs like OpenAI's, support an enum parameter, which we also use.\n",
        "Next, we take a look at the Relationship class\n",
        "```\n",
        "class Relationship(BaseRelationship):\n",
        "    source_node_id: str\n",
        "    source_node_label: str = Field(..., description=f\"Available options are {enum_values}\")\n",
        "    target_node_id: str\n",
        "    target_node_label: str = Field(..., description=f\"Available options are {enum_values}\")\n",
        "    type: str = Field(..., description=f\"Available options are {enum_values}\")\n",
        "    properties: Optional[List[Property]]\n",
        "```\n",
        "This is the second iteration of the Relationship class. Initially, we used a nested Node object for the source and target nodes, but we quickly found that nested objects reduced the accuracy and quality of the extraction process. So, we decided to flatten the source and target nodes into separate fields-for example, source_node_id and source_node_label, along with target_node_id and target_node_label. Additionally, we define the allowed values in the descriptions for node labels and relationship types to ensure the LLMs adhere to the specified graph schema.\n",
        "The tool-based extraction approach enables us to define properties for both nodes and relationships. Below is the class we used to define them.\n",
        "class Property(BaseModel):\n",
        "    \"\"\"A single property consisting of key and value\"\"\"\n",
        "    key: str = Field(..., description=f\"Available options are {enum_values}\")\n",
        "    value: str\n",
        "Each Property is defined as a key-value pair. While this approach is flexible, it has its limitations. For instance, we can't provide a unique description for each property, nor can we specify certain properties as mandatory while others optional, so all properties are defined as optional. Additionally, properties aren't defined individually for each node or relationship type but are instead shared across all of them.\n",
        "We've also implemented a detailed system prompt to help guide the extraction. In my experience, though, the function and argument descriptions tend to have a greater impact than the system message.\n",
        "Unfortunately, at the moment, there is no simple way to customize function or argument descriptions in LLM Graph Transformer.\n",
        "## Prompt-based extraction\n",
        "Since only a few commercial LLMs and LLaMA 3 support native tools, we implemented a fallback for models without tool support. You can also set ignore_tool_usage=True to switch to a prompt-based approach even when using a model that supports tools.\n",
        "Most of the prompt engineering and examples for the prompt-based approach were contributed by Geraldus Wilsen.\n",
        "With the prompt-based approach, we have to define the output structure directly in the prompt. You can find the whole prompt here. In this blog post, we'll just do a high-level overview. We start by defining the system prompt.\n",
        "```\n",
        "You are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph. Your task is to identify the entities and relations specified in the user prompt from a given text and produce the output in JSON format. This output should be a list of JSON objects, with each object containing the following keys:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **\"head\"**: The text of the extracted entity, which must match one of the types specified in the user prompt.\n",
        "- **\"head_type\"**: The type of the extracted head entity, selected from the specified list of types.\n",
        "- **\"relation\"**: The type of relation between the \"head\" and the \"tail,\" chosen from the list of allowed relations.\n",
        "- **\"tail\"**: The text of the entity representing the tail of the relation.\n",
        "- **\"tail_type\"**: The type of the tail entity, also selected from the provided list of types.\n",
        "\n",
        "Extract as many entities and relationships as possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Entity Consistency**: Ensure consistency in entity representation. If an entity, like \"John Doe,\" appears multiple times in the text under different names or pronouns (e.g., \"Joe,\" \"he\"), use the most complete identifier consistently. This consistency is essential for creating a coherent and easily understandable knowledge graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Important Notes**:\n",
        "- Do not add any extra explanations or text.\n",
        "```\n",
        "In the prompt-based approach, a key difference is that we ask the LLM to extract only relationships, not individual nodes. This means we won't have any isolated nodes, unlike with the tool-based approach. Additionally, because models lacking native tool support typically perform worse, we do not allow extraction any propertiesâ-âwhether for nodes or relationships, to keep the extraction output simpler.\n",
        "Next, we add a couple of few-shot examples to the model.\n",
        "```\n",
        "examples = [\n",
        "    {\n",
